# Project Future notes

## Laundry list

- [ ] Chat

  - [ ] Better title deduce
  - [ ] Details of request are not visible immediately. We use a trapper in golang ai provider package to get req/resp details, that means until the completion returns there is no way of getting the request details. Some refactoring of workflow is needed to make this happen.
  - [ ] Need a stop streaming / cancel button on assistant
  - [ ] Think through:
    - [ ] In AI replies, find a way to mention the model used and special params a bit more explicitly.
    - [ ] Check whether current details is good enough UX or need a bit better subtle ux.
  - [ ] Support for image/audio in chat
  - [ ] Slash commands for prompts/tools/kb in chat
    - [ ] Should model selection also be in chat commands?
    - [ ] may be can be done as: @ invokes assistants. inbuilt models with current settings are default assistants.
  - [ ] support for read/attach file in chats and then write/save file (slightly different flow than download)
  - [ ] Think if needed:
    - [ ] Users can mark a query to be not included in the chat message conversation history when talking to llm.
    - [ ] This is query level control which is different from the generic control.
    - [ ] Ignore history command structure:
      - [ ] Global on/off switch like right now
      - [ ] Query level switch overrides the global switch.

- [ ] Chats vs Chat with AI from home

  - [ ] Should one create a new chat, and other load recent chat or go to search?
  - [ ] Do we want a home page at all? should it be direct chat landing page with redirects to other pages?

- [ ] Conversations

  - [ ] Support delete conversation.
  - [ ] Maybe, have soft delete then hard delete workflow.
  - [ ] Conversations ux decisions need to be reviewed again based on current experience with their usage.

- [ ] Windows

  - [ ] Signing for Win
  - [ ] Test Windows build

- [ ] Docs inside app
  - [ ] Have docs pages inside app itself

## Stricken out list

- [ ] ~~logger is imported in securejsondb before it is set as ipc file logger in appimage~~
- [ ] ~~Electron: currently supported only via appimagelauncher. Better do snap I suppose, but explore later.~~
- [ ] ~~Electron: see about package distribution and updates~~
- [ ] ~~Code interpreter for few languages baked in. This can be provided as a normal tool so that~~
- [ ] ~~Container build and publish~~

## MCP handling

- [ ] MCP transport

  - [ ] mcp httpsse
  - [ ] stdio for mcp

- [ ] Add servers for: file, git, simplemapstore

## Knowledge base

Implement a `DocStoreSet` that manages multiple `DocStore` instances within a Wails desktop application. Each `DocStore` can use different adapters (e.g., local file system, HTTP) and contains collections of documents. Documents are split into chunks and stored in a vector database as separate vector "documents".

### UI

- [x] Simple single page that lists servers + collections under them.
  - [x] KB server has some associated detail
  - [x] Collection row is still a visible row but placed so that it is visually known that it belongs to the server
- [x] Add/edit/remove buttons as needed
- [x] Modal to edit server details
- [x] Modal to edit collection details and Viewing documents within a collection and number of chunks info.
- [ ] Add/Edit docs inside the collections modal
- [ ] Integrate with backend

### Entity: `DocStoreSet`

- [ ] Top level entity

- [ ] **Create the `DocStoreSet` struct with the following fields:**

  ```go
  type DocStoreSet struct {
    MetadataPath string
    DocStores    map[DocStoreName]*DocStore
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Implement methods for `DocStoreSet`:**

  - Initialize the default local filesystem docstore and add it in the set.
  - Dont implement add for now. ~~`AddDocStore(name string, adapter Adapter)`: Adds a new docstore with the specified adapter.~~
  - `GetDocStore(name string) *DocStore`: Retrieves a docstore by name.
  - Dont implement add for now. ~~`RemoveDocStore(name string)`: Removes a docstore by name.~~
  - Dont implement list for now. ~~`ListDocStores() []string`: Lists all docstore names.~~

### Entity: `DocStore`

- [ ] Design the `DocStore` Interface

  - Initialize can be independent and store specific.

  ```go
  type DocStoreName string

  // DocStore interface for different storage backends
  type DocStore interface {
   GetCollections() (map[CollectionName]*Collection, error)
   AddCollection(name CollectionName) error
   AddDocument(collection string, doc *Document) error
   DeleteDocument(collection string, docID DocumentID) error
   ListDocuments(collection string) ([]*Document, error)
  }
  ```

- [ ] Implement the Default Local File Adapter

  - [ ] Create a `ChromemDocStore` struct implementing the `DocStore` interface.
  - [ ] Define the fields for `ChromemDocStore`
    - [ ] `BasePath` (string): Base file path for storing documents.
  - [ ] Implement the `DocStore` methods for `ChromemDocStore`.

- [ ] Support for HTTP-Based DocStores
  - [ ] Similarly implement a HTTPDocStore
  - [ ] Define the fields for `HTTPDocStore`:
    - `Endpoint` (string): Base URL of the HTTP docstore.
    - `Headers` (map[string]string): Optional headers for HTTP requests.

### Entity: `Collection`

- [ ] **Create the `Collection` struct with the following fields:**

  ```go
  type CollectionName string
  type Collection struct {
    Name      CollectionName
    Documents map[string]*Document
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Implement methods for `Collection`:**
  - `AddDocument(doc *Document) error`: Adds a new document.
  - `GetDocument(docID string) *Document`: Retrieves a document by ID.
  - `RemoveDocument(docID string) error`: Removes a document by ID.
  - `ListDocuments() ([]string, error)`: Lists all document IDs.

### Entity: `Document`

- [ ] Allow CRUD for docs inside a collection
- [ ] ~~May not need a separate page. docs list can be in collection page~~
- [ ] Create searchable chunked entities
- [ ] Need ways to integrate with doc type specific loader/chunker/semantic analyzer.
- [ ] A doc type is going to have specific loader and semantic parsers. E.g: PDF would need to extract text then do some semantic classification and then create chunks to store embeddings.
- [ ] Can provide basic already available loaders in app, but would need a defined hook for it.

- Document

  - Features

    - CRUD operations
    - Store and manage documents
    - Allow document upload and deletion
    - Provide search capabilities

- [ ] **Create the `Document` struct with the following fields:**

  - `ID` (string): Unique identifier for the document.
  - `Content` (string): Full content of the document.
  - `Metadata` (map[string]interface{}): Document metadata.

  ```go
  type Document struct {
    ID       string
    Content  string
    Chunks   []*Chunk
    Metadata map[string]interface{}
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Implement methods for `Document`:**

  - `SplitIntoChunks(chunkSize int) error`: Splits the document content into chunks.
  - `GetChunk(index int) (*Chunk, error)`: Retrieves a specific chunk by index.

- [ ] Define the `Chunk` Structure

  - `Index` (int): The order of the chunk in the document.
  - `Content` (string): The content of the chunk.
  - `VectorID` (string): Identifier in the vector database.

  ```go
  type Chunk struct {
    Index    int
    Content  string
    VectorID string
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Modify `Document.SplitIntoChunks` to:**

  - Split the document content into chunks of specified size.
  - For each chunk:
    - Create a `Chunk` instance.
    - Store the chunk in the vector database using `VectorStore.StoreChunk`.
    - Update the `VectorStore` in the `Chunk`.

### Entity: `VectorStore`

- Use VectoreStore interface from langchaingo and implement for chromamem for local files

## Apps

- [ ] Start with the noted apps support
