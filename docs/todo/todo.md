# Project TODO

## Laundry list

- [ ] tools should have a configuration which says can autoexecute i.e without user consent vs not.
  - [ ] with this config we can have a "agent loop" of sort for file edits/mods etc
  - [ ] major question remains as to what sort of tools should be auto exec vs not. write anything being human in loop is safest anycase. for write ones, we may want to see if we need to have a "keep old file as renamed" with some sessionid/tmp extension so that reverting is easier.
  - [ ] a tool call only and tool output only message may be rendered as a single line after this.
  - [ ] we may want to have a "assistant" like we planned before that has tool sets and autoexec config so that the "agent" loop is kind of autonomous
- [ ] File name and details also should be sent along with file text from attachments

## Features

- [ ] tool features
  - [ ] Implementation of openai/anthropic etc built-in tools that have been analyzed and filtered.
  - [x] Analysis of openai/anthropic etc given tools so that they can be invoked in api directly.
  - [ ] ~~parallel tools can be created locally~~
  - [ ] there is a reference calculator tool in claude docs
  - [ ] When url cannot fetch content, there is no way of knowing what happened as of now. may want to see hwo to expose this or disable link only mode in this flow?

- [ ] valid input output modalities, valid levels, valid reasoning types, etc need to be added to modelpresetspec.

- [ ] Token count in build completion data may be wrong as it doesn't really account for attachments/tool calls etc.
  - [ ] Need to rectify the FilterMessagesByTokenCount function. Look at using gpt5 bpe encoder now rather than regex compilation. [go-tokenizer](https://github.com/tiktoken-go/tokenizer)
  - [ ] Claude has a free token counting api with some rate limits. may need to check it out too.

## Milestone thoughts

- [ ] M1 - API coverage - Pending items:
  - [ ] Modalities coverage:
    - [x] Text
      - [x] content in/out
      - [x] reasoning in/out
      - [x] extracted web pages input
      - [x] extracted pdf input
      - [ ] extracted other docs input, sheets and docx mainly.
    - [x] Image input
    - [x] Document input
    - [x] Image url input
    - [x] Document url input

  - [ ] Tools
    - [x] built-in tools from apis
      - [x] web search

    - [ ] local replacements for some builtin tools that are very vendor specific
      - [ ] bash: yes.
      - [ ] apply patch: No. this is very error prone, cosnidering unidiff vs V4A diff formats and compatibility issues.
      - [ ] text editor: yes
      - [ ] tool search tool: we may need a tool search tool that does sqlite based bm25 search or regex search like from anthropic

    - [x] Dont: New stateful APIs and its hooks from vendors
      - [x] stored responses, stored conversations, on server memory context, on server prompt templates etc.

  - [ ] i18n
  - [ ] provider and model level allow disallow list of model params/capabilities etc.
  - [ ] Some more additional params in presets and advanced params modal.
    - [ ] tool choice tuning
    - [ ] verbosity tuning
    - [ ] top k
    - [ ] Not sure: Safety parameter, that identifies a user if they violate safety policies.
    - [ ] Not sure: stop strings
    - [ ] Not sure: cache control in claude

- [ ] M2 - Better context
  - [ ] MCP local connections and hooks
  - [ ] MCP options in apis connections and hooks
  - [ ] Doc stores/vector stores connections
    - [ ] Only if MCP cannot serve this.

- [ ] Agent Skills but via local "explorer" or "skills" flow???

- [ ] Deferred.
  - [ ] Image output: See inference-go notes.
  - [ ] audio in/out
